# PandasBasketball
PandasBasketball is a small module intended to scrape data from [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and convert it to useful pandas data structures, such as data frames, for future analytical purposes. The use of jupyter notebooks is encouraged.

# Installation
If installing using `conda` environments:

```
conda create -n bball-analyst python=3.6
conda activate bball-analyst
pip install -U git+ssh://git@github.com/duncancfraser/PandasBasketball.git@make-pip-installable#egg=PandasBasketball
```

If installing to root (not recommended):
`pip install -U git+ssh://git@github.com/duncancfraser/PandasBasketball.git@make-pip-installable#egg=PandasBasketball`

That's it.
You can then import it to your jupyter environment:
```
from PandasBasketball import pandasbasketball as pb
```

## Requirements
These requirement will also install with PandasBasketball:
- Python 3.6+
- requests
- pandas
- Beautiful Soup 4

All the requirements can easily be met with the installation of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution.

# Usage
## :basketball: Players
Inside a player's page on the basketball-reference website you can find several tables, and most of these tables can be obtained as a pandas data frame by calling `get_player(player, stat)`. The 'player' refers to the name of the html file used by basketball-reference inside the url, and the 'stat' means the type of table.

The currently supported tables are:
- Per Game (`per_game`)
- Totals (`totals`)
- Per 36 Minutes (`per_minute`)
- Per 100 Poss (`per_poss`)
- Advanced (`advanced`)
- Playoffs Per Game (`playoffs_per_game`)
- Playoffs Totals (`playoffs_totals`)
- Playoffs Per 36 Minutes (`playoffs_per_minute`)
- Playoffs Per 100 Poss (`playoffs_per_poss`)
- Playoffs Advanced (`playoffs_advanced`)

The rest of the tables will come in the future.

### Example
To get the 'Per Game' table for LeBron James you would do something like this:
```
df = pb.get_player("jamesle01", "per_game")
```

### Optional Arguments
The `get_player()` method supports two optional arguments:
- `numeric` - returns the data frame with its columns alreay converted to numeric
- `s_index` - returns the data frame with its column 'Season' as the index

Both are set to `False` by deault.

### Considerations
- The resulting data frame **does not** include the table's footer.
- The resulting data frame will have the same column names as the table's header but it will not have a set index. To set the 'Season' column as index set the argument `s_index` to `True`. 
- The columns will be of type 'object', so in order to perform arithmetic functions on them you will need to convert them to numeric. You can do something like this:
```
lbj_pg = pb.get_player("jamesle01", "per_game")
lbj_pg[lbj_pg.columns] = lbj_pg[lbj_pg.columns].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors="ignore")
```
Or you cant set the optional argument `numeric` to `True`.

## :basketball: Player Game Logs
You can get all of a player's games in a season by calling `get_player_gamelog(player, season)`. The `season` argument must be the last year in which the season took place. 

### Example
To get all of Kawhi Leonard's games during the 2017-2018 season:
```
df = pb.get_player_gamelog("leonaka01", "2018")
```

### Optional Arguments
The function `get_player_gamelog` supports one optional argument:
- `playoffs` - returns **only** the playoffs games if set to `True`

Set to `False` by default.

### Considerations
- The resulting data frame will use the 'Rk' column as its index
- The data frame does not include those rows which are just the header again
- If the player missed a game, the row will be filled with blanks ("")

## :basketball: Last n days
Get a data frame with all the season's available players stats over the last n days by calling `get_n_days(days)`.

### Example
```
df = pb.get_n_days(10)
```
### Optional arguments
`get_n_days` supports one optional argument: 
- `player` - returns a pandas series with the stats of the specifed player

`player` is set to `all` by default.

### Considerations
- The resulting data frame will have the column 'Players' as its index by default
- The data frame is in descending order by GmSc

## :basketball: Teams
You can call a team's seasons table with `get_team(name)`. The argument `name` is the team's three-letter abbreviation (e.g. OKC, MAV).

### Example
To get OKC's table:
```
df = pb.get_team("OKC")
```

# Future
- Add support for the rest of tables on a player's page
- Implement function to obtain team stats per season
- ~~Implement function to get the last n days stats~~
- Implement function to obtain game results by date
- Get player stats against a team
- Make a small GUI application for non-programmers
- Create setup.py 

# Known Issues
- ~~Players that did not play certain seasons for whatever reason (e.g. Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson) will get shifted values.~~ Fixed; if a player missed a whole season and then returned to the league, then those rows in the 'Per Game' table will not be added to the resulting data frame.
- ~~`get_player_season` **wil not work** if a player missed a game for whatever reason.~~ This *should* be fixed now, at least if the reason was 'Inactive', 'Did Not Play', or 'Did Not Dress'. I'm oblivious if there is another justification for a player's absence used in basketball-reference.
